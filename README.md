# Spam Email Filter

A machine learning model designed to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content.

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods to accurately identify and filter out spam emails. It uses different classifiers and text embedding techniques to optimize performance and ensure high accuracy.

## Features

- **Email Filtering**: Classifies emails into 'spam' and 'not spam' categories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses email text data for optimal machine learning application.
- **Multiple ML Models**: Includes Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers among others to evaluate and select the best performer.
- **Text Embedding**: Utilizes various text embedding techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **NLP Libraries**: Includes NLTK for text preprocessing and Gensim for Doc2Vec and Word2Vec implementations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk gensim

## Model Performance and Results
The models are evaluated using several metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Detailed results and comparisons across different models and embedding techniques are available in the project report.
